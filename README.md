# Project Title
Machine Learning Model for Image Classification

# Description
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that can classify images into different categories. The model is built using Python and utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

# How to Run Program
To run the program, you will need to install Python and the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

After installing the necessary libraries, you can run the program by executing the main.py file using the command python main.py in your terminal.

# Files Used
*The following files are used in this project:*

main.py: the main file that contains the code for training the machine learning model and making predictions on test data
data.csv: a CSV file containing the image data and corresponding labels
model.h5: a file containing the trained machine learning model
Additional Documentation
